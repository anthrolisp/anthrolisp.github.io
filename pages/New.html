We contend that many of the pressing problems of our time, including climate change and global inequality, are direct consequences of the cosmology of the Moderns. As a platform for research and publication, one of our aims is to highlight experiments that attempt to diagnose and resolve the aporias of the Modern Constitution and the problems it engenders.</div><div class="ragged">The fragility of the nature/culture schema that organizes the division of the natural and social sciences requires new disciplinary configurations, new styles of doing research and engagement. Non-Standard thinking does not prejudge the affordances of its theoretical materials, their possible usages and combinations, but seeks the place of invention.</div><div class="ragged">No return to the Enlightenment, no return to tradition: simply return to the Universe. Oscillations thinks a time that is as eternal as it is contemporary, as ancient as it is futural. Even as oscillations aims to intervene in the now, oscillations roots itself in the deep time of the Universe.</div></div><div><div class="pheader">from <a class="empty" href="The-Sky-is-falling.html">The Sky is falling</a> <span>01 May 2021 02:50</span></div><div class="ragged">The Sky is falling</div></div><div><div class="pheader">from <a href="Call-for-Papers.html">Call for Papers</a> <span>01 May 2021 02:50</span></div><div class="ragged">Oscillations invites contributions to the project of a generic cosmological thinking, thinking with polytheistic, animist, and other practices that may be taken as “unserious” by the Modern orthodoxy. We do not reject Modern sciences and knowledges but seek to think with them without their overdetermining exclusivity and narcissism.</div><div class="ragged">We need to think with the Universe. We no longer maintain an exclusive relationship between the self and the other, the subject and the object of analysis, but explore a radical and mutual inclusion, grounded in the shared singularity of the Human.</div><div class="ragged">Thought is radically unbound, and beyond what can be conceived at any moment. It is grounded in nothing else but the Center of the Universe, where and what we are.</div></div><div><div class="pheader">from <a href="Zé-Antonio-Magalhães.html">Zé Antonio Magalhães</a> <span>28 Apr. 2021 10:27</span></div><div class="ragged"><span><b>Zé</b> holds a PhD in Legal Theory from PUC-Rio, a MPhil in Law from the National Faculty of Law, UFRJ, and a BA in Law from UFPel. Zé's <a class="external" href="https://pucrj.academia.edu/zamagalhaes">research</a> draws from contemporary theoretical currents such as speculative realism, accelerationism and the ontological turn in Anthropology to produce what he calls a "speculative legal theory" or "speculative nomics". This is a thought and practice which doesn't take for granted the manifest image of modern law, but rather asks what else law might become or be found to have always been. </span></div><div class="ragged">He is interested in bridging the modern distinction between "positive" and "natural law", and in how the rights of non-humans (such as rivers or the earth) might be conceived as emanating from the mode of being and perspective of such entities, rather than as being posited in modern law. To achieve that, Zé's work draws on a re-reading of legal theorists such as Hans Kelsen and Carl Schmitt through the lenses of cosmopolitics and Amerindian perspectivism. </div><div class="ragged"><span>Zé is also currently involved in the development of new platforms for research, teaching and practice in the post/non/in/humanities, mainly in connection to <a class="external" href="https://thenewcentre.org/">The New Centre for Research and Practice</a> (U.S.A.) and <a class="external" href="https://apph.com.br/">Associação de Pesquisas e Práticas em Humanidades</a> (Brazil), as well as in the dissemination of cosmopolitical discussion, especially through <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4CgSpWoOQOypPFjhVOBcA">Transe</a>.</span></div></div></div></div></div><!-- Sidebar Widgets Column --><div class="col-md-4"><!-- Search Widget --><div class="card my-4"><h5 class="card-header">Search</h5><div class="card-body"><div class="input-group"><input class="form-control" id="searcht" onkeyup="keypress(event)" placeholder="Search for..." type="text" /></div><div id="searcho" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px;"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><!-- Footer --><footer class="py-5 footer"><div class="container"><p class="m-0 text-center text-white">Copyright © <a href="http://oscillations.one" style="color: white;">MySite</a> 2020-2021</p><p class="m-0 text-center text-white small">Exported 11 May 2021 03:04</p></div></footer></body></html>
