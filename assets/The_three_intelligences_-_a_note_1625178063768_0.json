There are then three major areas of contemporary anthropological interest — the \"three intelligences,\" we could say, paraphrasing Guattari. These areas intersect, overlap, collaborate, and often collide with each other. For they dispute among themselves, in a more or less explicit way, the position of epistemological antecedence and/or ontological preeminence: each area may claim the title of the encompassing continent within which the other two are merely its provinces. Such tension should be seen as productive, not destructive.","create-time":1625174703728,"uid":"buh7Bcm5-","edit-time":1625174703735,":create/user":{":user/uid":"iVQCUaljGbd6sxXdr6qrdoPn2Sa2"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"iVQCUaljGbd6sxXdr6qrdoPn2Sa2"}},{"string":"The first area we will call \"cultural\" intelligence. Its thematic center is the difference between human ways of world-making, a difference that historically conditions the relation (political, epistemic etc.) between these ways. This is the region traversed by classical sociocultural anthropology, but also by the so-called \"ontological turn\" of this discipline, just as much by the problematic described by the adjective \"decolonial.\"","create-time":1625174703728,"uid":"zdTIntOv8","edit-time":1625174703735,":create/user":{":user/uid":"iVQCUaljGbd6sxXdr6qrdoPn2Sa2"},":edit/user":{":user/uid":"iVQCUaljGbd6sxXdr6qrdoPn2Sa2"}},{"string":"The second is \"natural\" intelligence. Its focus is the other-than-human ways of world-making, and as often as not the relation of these to different human ways of world-making.
