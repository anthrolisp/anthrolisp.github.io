Z\u00e9's  research \u00a0draws from contemporary theoretical currents such as speculative realism, accelerationism and the ontological turn in Anthropology to produce what he calls a \"speculative legal theory\" or \"speculative nomics\". This is a thought and practice which doesn't take for granted the manifest image of modern law, but rather asks what else law might become or be found to have always been.  He is interested in bridging the modern distinction between \"positive\" and \"natural law\", and in how the rights of non-humans (such as rivers or the earth) might be conceived as emanating from the mode of being and perspective of such entities, rather than as being posited in modern law. To achieve that, Z\u00e9's work draws on a re-reading of legal theorists such as Hans Kelsen and Carl Schmitt through the lenses of cosmopolitics and Amerindian perspectivism.  Z\u00e9 is also currently involved in the development of new platforms for research, teaching and practice in the post\/non\/in\/humanities, mainly in connection to  The New Centre for Research and Practice  (U.S.A.) and  Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Pesquisas e Pr\u00e1ticas em Humanidades  (Brazil), as well as in the dissemination of cosmopolitical discussion, especially through  Transe . Nomics and demogrammar This thesis intends an opening move in the field of legal theory as well as in that of law and technology studies, and especially in the intersection of the two. It tries to construct a theory of law and of its relation to technology that allows for the navigation of the contemporary passage from what I call modern nomics to a platform nomics linked to the emergence of planetary scale computation, algorithmic governance and the climate crisis. To do that, I first try to make a contribution to a speculative legal theory (neither an \u201cinternal\u201d theory of modern law as we know it, nor a critical\/deconstructive legal theory). I do so by reading two key thinkers of modern law, Hans Kelsen and Carl Schmitt, as complementary, and through currents of the so-called \u201cspeculative turn\u201d in contemporary theory. Kelsen is read as an accelerationist\/inhumanist, and Schmitt in light of cosmo\/geontopolitics, while Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s assemblage theory serves as a background through which the rest is connected. Secondly, I mobilize this conceptual apparatus to speculate about platform nomics. I build nomic concepts of code, platform, device, application, interface and user. Algorithmic demogrammar is defined as operating by massive data collection, tracing of graphs and modulation of conducts. I look to trace some tendencies in the transition to platform nomics, e.g. to the contingency of the positions of person and thing, to the indistinction between norm and bias, to the non-instrumentality of technics, to the plurality of worlds, to the superimposition of nomoi, to the confusion of cognition and governance etc. I finish by offering three speculative models\/paradigms for the navigation of platform nomics \u2013 an inhuman model, based on the hypothesis of general intelligence; an animistic paradigm, linked to the Gaia hypothesis\/myth, and, finally, a tentative composition between the two. Tecnomia e demogram\u00e1tica Esta pesquisa se pretende um movimento de abertura tanto no campo da teoria do direito quanto no dos estudos de direito e tecnologia, e em especial na intersec\u00e7\u00e3o entre esses campos. Ela busca construir uma teoria do direito e da sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com as t\u00e9cnicas que permita navegar a passagem contempor\u00e2nea entre o que chamo de tecnomia moderna e uma tecnomia das plataformas ligada \u00e0 emerg\u00eancia da computa\u00e7\u00e3o em escala global, da governan\u00e7a algor\u00edtmica e da crise clim\u00e1tica. Para tanto, busco, em primeiro lugar, contribuir para uma teoria especulativa do direito (nem uma teoria \u201cinterna\u201d do direito moderno como o conhecemos, nem uma teoria cr\u00edtica\/desconstrutiva do direito). Procuro faz\u00ea-lo lendo dois pensadores chave do direito moderno, Hans Kelsen e Carl Schmitt, como complementares e \u00e0 luz de correntes da chamada \u201cvirada especulativa\u201d da filosofia contempor\u00e2nea. Kelsen \u00e9 lido como um aceleracionista\/inumanista, e Schmitt \u00e0 luz da cosmo\/geontopol\u00edtica, enquanto a filosofia dos agenciamentos de Deleuze e Guattari serve como o fundo pelo qual tudo isso se articula. Em segundo lugar, mobilizo esse aparato a fim de especular sobre uma tecnomia das plataformas. Construo conceitos tecn\u00f4micos de c\u00f3digo, plataforma, dispositivo, aplicativo, interface e usu\u00e1rio.

We contend that many of the pressing problems of our time, including climate change and global inequality, are direct consequences of the cosmology of the Moderns. As a platform for research and publication, one of our aims is to highlight experiments that attempt to diagnose and resolve the aporias of the Modern Constitution and the problems it engenders. The fragility of the nature\/culture schema that organizes the division of the natural and social sciences requires new disciplinary configurations, new styles of doing research and engagement. Non-Standard thinking does not prejudge the affordances of its theoretical materials, their possible usages and combinations, but seeks the place of invention. No return to the Enlightenment, no return to tradition: simply return to the Universe. Oscillations thinks a time that is as eternal as it is contemporary, as ancient as it is futural.

We have inherited a way of thinking and doing that has been disastrous for the human. Many of the pressing problems of our time, including climate change and global inequality, are a direct consequence of the cosmology of the Moderns. We need to rebuild the World Tree, to learn again to live well between Sky and Earth. Oscillations invites contributions to the project of a generic cosmological thinking, thinking with polytheistic, animist, and other practices that may be taken as \u201cunserious\u201d by the Modern orthodoxy. We do not reject Modern sciences and knowledges but seek to think with them without their overdetermining exclusivity and narcissism. We need to think with the Universe. We no longer maintain an exclusive relationship between the self and the other, the subject and the object of analysis, but explore a radical and mutual inclusion, grounded in the shared singularity of the Human. Thought is radically unbound, and beyond what can be conceived at any moment. It is grounded in nothing else but the Center of the Universe, where and what we are. We are seeking contributions that seek to reconfigure our notions of the human, the animal, technology, and divinity by creating linkages across science, philosophy, myth, and other practices. We are interested in a science of form, symmetry, and transformation, in order to think the reciprocities of thinking, as holograms of the universe.
